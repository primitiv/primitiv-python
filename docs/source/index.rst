`primitiv <https://github.com/primitiv/primitiv-python>`_
is a neural network library developed by
`National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) <https://www.nict.go.jp/en/index.html>`_
and
`Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) <http://www.naist.jp/en/>`_.
primitiv allows users to write their own networks using a *define-by-run* style
construction methods, and most features in the library is designed
device-independent.
Users can perform the own network using various computing backends such as
Eigen, CUDA and OpenCL with no (or few) modifications of the original code.

This document describes the official Python frontend of the primitiv library.
If you prefer to know about the primitiv C++ core library, follow
